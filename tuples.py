##tuple : its a kind of datastructure which basically means it's a conatiner where we can store different values

##how to create a tuple
coordinates = (4,5) #tuples can never be change
print(coordinates[1])

##we can modify tuple by creating a tuple into a list
coordinates = [(4,5) , (6,8) , (0,9)]
coordinates[1] = 10
print(coordinates[1])

##we use tuples in only special situations
